# Bioinformatics Support for CFAR

The [HSPH Bioinformatics Core](https://hsphbio.ghost.io/) (HBC) provides bioinformatics support for researchers at the [Harvard University Center for AIDS Research(http://cfar.globalhealth.harvard.edu/) (CFAR). 

Our Core staff are available to help with the **management, integration, and contextual analysis of high-throughput biological data**, focusing on **next-generation sequencing support**. We [provide consulting, tools, databases and best practices](#services), while fostering collaboration and a community of bioinformatic activities. We also build unified infrastructure to support a diverse set of experimental systems and high-throughput biological data.

With the help of CFAR funding, HBC can now **offer subsidized [consults](#fees)** to researchers with an affiliation to the Center for AIDS Research at Harvard. Please [contact us](#contact) with any questions and support requests you might have.
